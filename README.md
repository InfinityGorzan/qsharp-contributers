Do you want to contribute in my programming language (Q#)?

To contribute, create an issue like this:

Message:

```

You can check issues tab for example new user (how should it look like).

To check it, search issues for "is:issue is:close ".

You will get a comment in your issue if it is accepted like this and will be closed.
